# LetterCounter
This is my Letter Counting Program in C++. It will read a selected .txt file and then count the selected letters {A,E,I,O,U,T,K,H}. Using functions to read the selected .txt file it uses if statements to attribute the selected letters to a variable as an integer and count each time they are read in the file. There is a formula to add up all the selected letters and to display the sum of the amount of time all the letters are read as an integer.
